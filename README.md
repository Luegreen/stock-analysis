 #stock-analysis
 
 ### Overview of Project
 Using VBA, the objective was to create code that could analyse multiple stocks with the click of a button, aiding a hypothetical client in chosing a successful stock purchase for his parents. He was headed to DQ and, with the aid of this analysis will be able to make a solid recomendation. 
 
 ### Results
 Comparing Preformance between 2017 and 2018 for VBA Stocks:
 
 The price of the 12 stocks reviewed experienced an overall increased over the year of 2017 and then decreased in 2018.
 Only 58% of the 12 companies reviewed experienced an increase in volume.
 
 Regarding a choice for the client's parents of the most successful stock choice, there is one clear winner but I will list the top x choices: 
 - ENPH experienced an 129.5% increase in 2017 and another 81.9% increase in 2018 AS WELL AS an almost 300% increase in volume. This makes it clearly the best stock in which to invest.
 - SEDG experienced an 184% increase in 2017 and then dropped only 7.8% in 2018. The volume sold increased around 15%. This puts it in second place as a stock worth investment.
 - RUN experienced a modest 5.5% increase in 2017 but picked up in 2018 with a 84% increase. This perhaps drove a vlume increase of nearly 100% which bodes well for further trading aspirations. 
 
 The chart below shows each of the 12 stocks, their volume for 2017 and 2018 including an indication of change (green circle = volume increase, red circle = volume decrease from 2017 to 2018, as well as % price increase/decrease (green = increase, red = decrease).
